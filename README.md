Project Idea:- We have made an API that converts data into json and graphql format.It also involves converting data in json to graphql.
It also stores data and can be tested with postman

To test with Postman:
https://www.postman.com/

to convert in json format:
localhost:3000/routes/echo-all 
(echo-all can create any keys intended and value of user's choice)
localhost:3000/routes/time
(Here,user can add country in the key and the name of the country in the value,
thereby getting its present time).

to convert json into graphql:
localhost:3000/graphql
(here user adds the data before hand and the data can be achived in graphql format using either postman or the localhost webpage itself}
